At Renew Integrative Physical Therapy, we believe that true healing for patients begins with humility, service, and purpose. We are a Christ\\-centered, self\\-pay orthopedic practice committed to honoring God in our work, putting others before ourselves, and restoring people to full wellness. This is more than a job — it’s a calling.

The medical system is broken and as reimbursements go down and the need for wholistic healing increases, there is a great need for a different kind of healing through physical therapy. Physical therapy assistants are already being replaced by A.I., online exercise protocols and other professions such as massage therapy. Only the PTs who invest in themselves and train to approach healing differently will be able to meet the demands of a changing healthcare climate.

We believe we are that industry disrupter that our system needs – not by chasing titles or status, but by becoming excellent in both skill and spirit. We are looking for remarkable individuals with strong character, a heart for service, and a relentless pursuit of growth — not simply years of experience.

If you are ready to grow into the clinician and person you were meant to be, read on.

**Physical Therapist Assistant Opportunity Highlights**

* **Clinical Mentorship \\& Mastery**: Train in advanced, cutting\\-edge techniques that go beyond traditional PTA school curriculum. With deep mentorship and a focus on integrative healing, our team is elevated into the top 1% of clinicians in the country — both in outcomes and income.
* **Earn While You Learn:** We believe “high requirements deserve high reward.” That’s why we provide full compensation and benefits even during training, so you can grow without the burden of financial stress.
* **Leadership Development \\& Ownership Pathways:** We don’t just teach you how to treat — we equip you to lead. You’ll gain business acumen, leadership tools, and even the opportunity to open your own practice within our network, if that’s your calling.

**Who is Renew?**

Renew Integrative Physical Therapy is a true industry disruptor – not because we chase trends, but because we return to what matters most: outcomes for clients. We put patients before paperwork and purpose above profit. Every decision we make is grounded in honoring God, serving others with compassion, and delivering exceptional outcomes.

We seek to understand the root cause of dysfunction and provide care that brings lasting healing, not just temporary relief. Our model empowers clinicians to spend quality time with patients, apply advanced techniques like Fascial Counterstrain, and solve the complex problems others overlook.

At Renew, excellence isn’t a buzzword — it’s a culture. We attract physical therapist assistants who are hungry for growth, willing to be sharpened, and ready to lead a new standard of care. This is where mission meets mastery. If you're ready to make a difference and rise to your full potential, you're in the right place.

**Do You Have What It Takes to Join Renew?**

* **Full Commitment** – There is no halfway. We serve wholeheartedly.
* **Confidence** – Know what you know. Own what you don’t.
* **Humility** – Be teachable, flexible, and eager to grow.
* **Grit** – This path is not easy, but it’s worth it.

**Next Steps**

Only apply if you resonate with this mission and meet the criteria above. To be considered, please submit your resume and a cover letter that answers the following:

* Where do you see yourself in 5–10 years?
* What values are most important to you in an employer?
* What do you know about Fascial Counterstrain (if anything)?

**A Final Note**

We receive many applications and accept very few. If we don’t contact you, please know we are grateful for your interest and may reach out when a future opening aligns. We do not hire resumes — we hire people. People who are bold in faith, humble in heart, relentless in pursuit, and deeply aligned with our mission to bring true healing to the world.

At Renew Integrative Physical Therapy, we believe that true healing for patients begins with humility, service, and purpose. We are a Christ\\-centered, self\\-pay orthopedic practice committed to honoring God in our work, putting others before ourselves, and restoring people to full wellness. This is more than a job – it’s a calling.

The medical system is broken and as reimbursements go down and the need for wholistic healing increases, there is a great need for a different kind of healing through physical therapy. PTs are already being replaced by A.I., online exercise protocols and other professions such as massage therapy. Only the PTs who invest in themselves and train to approach healing differently will be able to meet the demands of a changing healthcare climate.

We believe we are that industry disrupter that our system needs – not by chasing titles or status, but by becoming excellent in both skill and spirit. We are looking for remarkable individuals with strong character, a heart for service, and a relentless pursuit of growth – not simply years of experience.

If you are ready to grow into the clinician and person you were meant to be, read on.

**Opportunity Highlights**

· **Clinical Mentorship \\& Mastery**  
Train in advanced, cutting\\-edge techniques that go beyond traditional PT school curriculum. With deep mentorship and a focus on integrative healing, our team is elevated into the top 1% of clinicians in the country — both in outcomes and income.

· **Earn While You Learn**  
We believe “high requirements deserve high reward.” That’s why we provide full compensation and benefits even during training, so you can grow without the burden of financial stress.

· **Leadership Development \\& Ownership Pathways**  
We don’t just teach you how to treat – we equip you to lead. You’ll gain business acumen, leadership tools, and even the opportunity to open your own practice within our network, if that’s your calling.

**Who is Renew?**  
Renew Integrative Physical Therapy is a true industry disruptor – not because we chase trends, but because we return to what matters most: outcomes for clients. We put patients before paperwork and purpose above profit. Every decision we make is grounded in honoring God, serving others with compassion, and delivering exceptional outcomes.

We seek to understand the root cause of dysfunction and provide care that brings lasting healing, not just temporary relief. Our model empowers clinicians to spend quality time with patients, apply advanced techniques like Fascial Counterstrain, and solve the complex problems others overlook.

At Renew, excellence isn’t a buzzword — it’s a culture. We attract physical therapists who are hungry for growth, willing to be sharpened, and ready to lead a new standard of care. This is where mission meets mastery. If you're ready to make a difference and rise to your full potential, you're in the right place.

**Do You Have What It Takes to Join Renew?**

* **Full Commitment** – There is no halfway. We serve wholeheartedly.
* **Confidence** – Know what you know. Own what you don’t.
* **Humility** – Be teachable, flexible, and eager to grow.
* **Grit** – This path is not easy, but it’s worth it.

**Next Steps**

Only apply if you resonate with this mission and meet the criteria above. To be considered, please submit your resume and a cover letter that answers the following:

* Where do you see yourself in 5–10 years?
* What values are most important to you in an employer?
* What do you know about Fascial Counterstrain (if anything)?

**A Final Note**

We do not hire resumes – we hire people. We hire people who are bold in faith, humble in heart, relentless in pursuit, and deeply aligned with our mission to bring true healing to the world.
