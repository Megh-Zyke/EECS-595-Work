**About UPE Resources**

UPE Resources, Inc. is a mission\\-driven company providing professional **Utility Vegetation Management (UVM)**, arboriculture, and environmental consulting services nationwide. Founded in 2006, UPE has grown into a trusted leader in **vegetation inspection, wildfire mitigation, and utility asset protection** across California and beyond.

Our success is built on **field excellence, safety, and technical precision**. Every day, our inspectors and arborists work across diverse environments — from coastal communities to mountain corridors — delivering high\\-quality vegetation assessments that protect both people and infrastructure.

We combine the professionalism of a large firm with the agility and culture of a close\\-knit team. As we continue to expand nationally, we remain committed to **developing our people, advancing industry standards, and creating lasting career opportunities** for those passionate about trees, safety, and the environment.

**Overview**

UPE Resources is hiring motivated professionals to join our field inspection teams as **Consulting Utility Foresters (CUFs)** and **ISA Certified Arborists**. These are hands\\-on, field\\-based roles responsible for assessing vegetation near utility infrastructure, supporting wildfire mitigation, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

This is an opportunity to build a **meaningful outdoor career** while contributing to public safety and environmental protection. Our employees work independently in the field, applying technical knowledge, sound judgment, and communication skills to deliver accurate, data\\-driven inspections.

UPE offers a **structured career path** from entry\\-level trainees to certified arborists, supported by paid training, credential reimbursement, and mentorship from experienced professionals. Whether you’re new to the industry or an ISA\\-certified arborist seeking advancement, this role provides the opportunity to grow within a company that values **technical excellence, field leadership, and professional development**.

**Career Pathways \\& Pay Structure**

UPE Resources offers a clear and achievable career progression for professionals in utility vegetation management. Each level reflects growing technical expertise, arboricultural knowledge, and leadership responsibility — supported by hands\\-on training, mentorship, and credential development. Employees are encouraged to advance through education, certification, and demonstrated field performance.

**Entry Level – CUF Trainee / CUF I ($23 – $27\\.50/hr)**These positions are ideal for both new and developing professionals eager to begin or advance a career in arboriculture and vegetation management. Employees learn the fundamentals of vegetation inspection, safety protocols, species identification, and the use of GPS/GIS\\-based mapping technology.  
Trainees and CUF I foresters work under the guidance of experienced mentors, gaining real\\-world experience in field operations, data collection, and vegetation clearance standards. This level builds the essential technical, observational, and communication skills required to progress toward fully independent inspection work.

**Intermediate Level – CUF II / CUF III ($28 – $36/hr)**At this stage, team members operate independently in the field with strong knowledge of vegetation clearance requirements, inspection accuracy, and client communication. CUF II and III professionals demonstrate confidence in tree identification, hazard recognition, and environmental awareness while applying regional vegetation standards and utility\\-specific protocols.  
These inspectors play an essential role in maintaining quality and consistency across projects. They are trusted to make field decisions, support quality control efforts, and collaborate directly with utility partners or vegetation crews. Strong technical proficiency with GIS/mobile software and consistent documentation are critical at this level. Continued training, testing, and mentorship prepare employees for certification and higher technical roles.

**Certified Level – Arborist I / II / III ($40 – $48/hr)**ISA Certified Arborists represent the highest tier of technical expertise within UPE’s field operations. Arborists apply advanced arboricultural science and professional standards to vegetation inspection, risk assessment, and compliance management. Their work involves interpreting complex vegetation conditions, diagnosing tree health, and applying ISA and ANSI A300 standards to inform vegetation management recommendations.  
Arborists also play a key role in **mentoring field inspectors, supporting training initiatives, and driving quality improvement** across projects. As seasoned professionals, they often collaborate with utility clients on sensitive or high\\-priority sites, contribute to vegetation planning and audits, and serve as technical advisors to management.  
This level serves as the **primary development pathway toward future leadership roles**, including field supervision and operational management. Arborists who demonstrate strong communication, mentorship, and organizational skills are positioned to advance into UPE’s leadership track — guiding teams, shaping field programs, and supporting the next generation of professionals in the industry.

At Renew Integrative Physical Therapy, we believe that true healing for patients begins with humility, service, and purpose. We are a Christ\\-centered, self\\-pay orthopedic practice committed to honoring God in our work, putting others before ourselves, and restoring people to full wellness. This is more than a job — it’s a calling.

The medical system is broken and as reimbursements go down and the need for wholistic healing increases, there is a great need for a different kind of healing through physical therapy. Physical therapy assistants are already being replaced by A.I., online exercise protocols and other professions such as massage therapy. Only the PTs who invest in themselves and train to approach healing differently will be able to meet the demands of a changing healthcare climate.

We believe we are that industry disrupter that our system needs – not by chasing titles or status, but by becoming excellent in both skill and spirit. We are looking for remarkable individuals with strong character, a heart for service, and a relentless pursuit of growth — not simply years of experience.

If you are ready to grow into the clinician and person you were meant to be, read on.

**Physical Therapist Assistant Opportunity Highlights**

* **Clinical Mentorship \\& Mastery**: Train in advanced, cutting\\-edge techniques that go beyond traditional PTA school curriculum. With deep mentorship and a focus on integrative healing, our team is elevated into the top 1% of clinicians in the country — both in outcomes and income.
* **Earn While You Learn:** We believe “high requirements deserve high reward.” That’s why we provide full compensation and benefits even during training, so you can grow without the burden of financial stress.
* **Leadership Development \\& Ownership Pathways:** We don’t just teach you how to treat — we equip you to lead. You’ll gain business acumen, leadership tools, and even the opportunity to open your own practice within our network, if that’s your calling.

**Who is Renew?**

Renew Integrative Physical Therapy is a true industry disruptor – not because we chase trends, but because we return to what matters most: outcomes for clients. We put patients before paperwork and purpose above profit. Every decision we make is grounded in honoring God, serving others with compassion, and delivering exceptional outcomes.

We seek to understand the root cause of dysfunction and provide care that brings lasting healing, not just temporary relief. Our model empowers clinicians to spend quality time with patients, apply advanced techniques like Fascial Counterstrain, and solve the complex problems others overlook.

At Renew, excellence isn’t a buzzword — it’s a culture. We attract physical therapist assistants who are hungry for growth, willing to be sharpened, and ready to lead a new standard of care. This is where mission meets mastery. If you're ready to make a difference and rise to your full potential, you're in the right place.

**Do You Have What It Takes to Join Renew?**

* **Full Commitment** – There is no halfway. We serve wholeheartedly.
* **Confidence** – Know what you know. Own what you don’t.
* **Humility** – Be teachable, flexible, and eager to grow.
* **Grit** – This path is not easy, but it’s worth it.

**Next Steps**

Only apply if you resonate with this mission and meet the criteria above. To be considered, please submit your resume and a cover letter that answers the following:

* Where do you see yourself in 5–10 years?
* What values are most important to you in an employer?
* What do you know about Fascial Counterstrain (if anything)?

**A Final Note**

We receive many applications and accept very few. If we don’t contact you, please know we are grateful for your interest and may reach out when a future opening aligns. We do not hire resumes — we hire people. People who are bold in faith, humble in heart, relentless in pursuit, and deeply aligned with our mission to bring true healing to the world.
