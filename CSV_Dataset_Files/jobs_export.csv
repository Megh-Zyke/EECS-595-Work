It’s a perfect fit for someone who thrives at the intersection of empathy and execution, and who finds meaning in turning a moment of vulnerability into one of reassurance and trust.

This role is especially well-suited for someone with an interest in mental health and healthcare access – since you’ll often be the first emotional point of contact for individuals seeking care.

Who You Are
• Empathetic and clear communicator. You speak with kindness, listen actively, and make others feel at ease – even during difficult or emotional conversations.
• Highly organized and detail-oriented. You can juggle multiple patients at different stages in the process and never let things slip through the cracks.
• Tech-comfortable. You’re comfortable learning tools like Google Workspace, EHR platforms (e.g., Healthie), or CRMs like HubSpot, and pick up new software quickly.
• Mission-aligned. You care deeply about improving care for older adults and are excited to play a key role in someone’s first step toward better mental health.
• Experience welcome, not required. You may have worked in healthcare, customer service, or an administrative support role before – but most importantly, you’re organized, compassionate, and eager to grow.

Why Join Sailor Health
• Mission with impact. Help bring life-changing care to a population that’s too often overlooked.
• Remote-first team. Enjoy the flexibility of remote work while staying closely connected with a thoughtful, collaborative team rooted in purpose.
• Growth and ownership. Be part of a small, agile team where you’ll take initiative, shape key processes, and grow as we grow.
• Make someone’s day – every day. Your work helps older adults and their families feel seen, supported, and cared for.

Customer Support Specialist,Pinpoint,Anywhere,"Customer Support Specialist

Department: Customer Support

Employment Type: Full Time

Location: United Kingdom

Reporting To: Emilia Carvell

Compensation: £35,000 - £40,000 / year
Description
Hi 👋 I’m Emilia, Customer Support Team Lead here at Pinpoint.

We’re a high-growth HR tech start-up building and selling software that helps in-house recruitment teams attract, hire, and onboard the right talent. Today, we have a strong foundation in place—with a mature product, rapid growth, strong product-market fit, and happy customers.

Behind that success is a support team that treats every interaction as part of the product experience. We keep response times low (sub-2-minute first response on live chat) and customer satisfaction high. As more customers join Pinpoint, we’re adding another Customer Support Specialist (11am–7:30pm) to help us keep that standard.

This isn’t your average support role. Our customers expect fast, human, and helpful responses—delivered with care and tailored to their needs. You’ll need to be technically curious, comfortable juggling 100+ tickets per week, and excited to help solve problems for recruiters, HR teams, and hiring managers across different industries and experience levels.

The fine print (but way more exciting):
• This is a remote role based in the UK, with a few optional in-person team meetups each year. Our HQ is in Jersey, and our 80-person team is spread across the UK and US
• You’ll work Monday–Friday, 11a-7.30p UK time (with a one-hour lunch break), occasionally 9-5 when covering a colleague on holiday.
• Our clients often use different terminology—part of your job is translating what they’re asking into how they use Pinpoint, without relying on canned responses or help center links
• Pinpoint is a deep, ever-growing platform. You’ll need to learn fast, think clearly under pressure, and take full ownership of every ticket
• Our values shape how we work. We’re looking for people who embody these values in everything they do

About the Role
• Own customer tickets end-to-end via Intercom (live chat + email), averaging 100+ per week
• Respond to customers within 2 minutes on average via live chat—we move fast and pride ourselves on it
• Maintain fast close times while delivering personal, context-aware support (no copy/paste macros here).
• Investigate technical issues, replicate bugs, and escalate appropriately—partnering closely with Engineering when needed.
• Help clients understand and adopt new features as they’re released.
• Maintain our 98%+ positive CSAT rating by delivering helpful, tailored support.
• Contribute to internal documentation, troubleshooting guides, and process improvements to help the team scale.
• Stay composed and personable even when managing a high ticket load or multiple live chats.

Tech stack: Intercom, Linear, Google Suite, Slack, HubSpot.

About You
• 2+ years of customer support experience in a live chat/email-heavy role—not phone-queue or script-based support.
• Ideally experienced supporting a B2B SaaS platform (HR tech experience is a plus).
• Used to owning end-to-end tickets (including escalated ones)—not just handing them off.
• Comfortable in a fast-paced, high-volume SaaS environment (100+ tickets/week).
• Clear, confident communicator—friendly but direct, with strong written skills and the ability to simplify complex topics without losing clarity or warmth.
• You write like a human: clear, conversational, and empathetic. No jargon. No robotic replies. Just thoughtful, well-structured messages that sound like you.
• Technically curious—you don’t need to code, but you’re eager to dig into how the platform works.
• Highly organized and proactive—able to track issues across time zones and see them through to resolution.
• Product-minded—you can put yourself in the customer’s shoes and translate what they’re asking into what the product is doing.
• Based in the UK with work authorization

💡 Huge bonus if you:
• Have experience troubleshooting integrations (e.g. HRIS, calendar, SSO, or job board systems)
• Are familiar with APIs, webhooks, or basic JSON concepts
• Have partnered closely with Product or Engineering teams to reproduce or escalate bugs
• Have experience testing new features or contributing to internal QA or documentation
• Love getting into the technical “why” behind customer issues, not just the “how” to fix them

What We Offer
We want Pinpoint to be the best place you’ve ever worked—somewhere you feel valued, supported, and excited to grow. Here’s what you’ll get:
• 🩺 Gold-plated healthcare – The best medical, dental, and optical coverage money can buy. We’ve got you (and your family) covered
• 🏝️ Unlimited holidays – Work-life balance matters. Take the time you need to rest, recharge, and enjoy life
• 🧠 Mental health support – Unlimited, immediate access to professional counseling through Spill—because your well-being comes first
• 💰 Retirement matching – A competitive plan to help you hit your long-term financial goals
• 🌍 Remote-first culture – Work where you're most productive. As a remote-first team, we prioritize flexibility and trust
• 📈 Meaningful equity – You’re helping build something special, and you should share in its success
• 👶 Generous parental leave – Up to 16 weeks of fully paid leave to support new parents
• 📚 Learning budget – Annual funds for courses, books, or anything else that fuels your personal and professional growth
• 💻 Top-of-the-line equipment – MacBook Pro, 4K monitors, and all the right tools to do your best work
• 🤝 A team that’s got your back – Smart, driven, kind people who want you to succeed, our clients to be wowed, and our business to grow

Copywriting Intern,MOI Global,Singapore,"About the MOI Academy Internship

At MOI Global, we don’t believe in token internships or week-long placements. We’re a forward-thinking B2B creative agency that invests in the next generation of talent. Our MOI Academy internship programme is a 6–12 months immersive experience – a launchpad for your marketing career. This isn’t about getting your foot in the door for a moment; it’s about finding your feet and growing with us for the long run. With a placement this substantial, you’ll have time to truly immerse yourself in the industry, develop real skills, and even open the door to a permanent role. It’s a transformative journey for interns who are serious about a career in marketing.

During your internship, you won’t just be working for us – you’ll be working with us. From day one, you’ll be an embedded member of our team, sharing in the creative brainstorms, tight deadlines, big wins, and learning experiences. We laugh together, sweat together (and maybe even shed the occasional tear together), just like any other team member tackling real projects. You’ll contribute meaningfully to our agency’s work and culture, making a real difference for both our team and our clients. In fact, MOI Academy interns get to work on real campaigns for real clients – including global tech brands you know and love. This is not a coffee-run kind of internship; this is a chance to roll up your sleeves and do work that matters in the B2B marketing world.
The Role

We’re on the hunt for a passionate, creative Copywriting Intern to join our vibrant marketing team in Singapore. This is your chance to hone your craft and contribute directly to projects that drive our brand’s success. You’ll be given responsibility (and guidance) to develop copy that captivates audiences and brings ideas to life. At MOI, we break the B2B mould – and as a copywriting intern, you’ll help us do just that with the power of words. This isn’t about shadowing in the background; you’ll create content that we’ll proudly put front and centre. Your words will help attract new customers, tell the MOI story, and deliver results for our campaigns.

As a Copywriting Intern, you will gain experience crafting engaging and persuasive copy across a variety of channels and formats, including:
• Websites: Write and update website content and landing pages with copy that hooks and informs.
• Social Media: Craft catchy social posts, captions, and ad copy that spark conversation and engagement.
• Email Campaigns: Develop email newsletters and campaign emails that our audiences want to open and act on.
• Blogs & Articles: Research and write insightful blog posts and articles that showcase thought leadership and creativity.
• And more: Basically, wherever there’s a need for a compelling narrative – from case studies and brochures to video script snippets – you’ll be there to lend your voice.

Throughout the internship, you’ll work closely with our experienced copywriters, designers, and strategists, learning how to adapt your writing to different mediums and client industries. One day you might be brainstorming taglines for a social campaign; the next, polishing a blog article or tweaking website copy for SEO. It’s a fast-paced, dynamic role where no two days are the same, and that’s all part of the fun!
What You’ll Gain

This isn’t just “resume filler” – it’s a true learning opportunity that will kickstart your career. Here’s what you can expect to get out of the MOI Academy copywriting internship:
• Real-world Experience: Hands-on involvement in a fast-paced B2B marketing agency environment. You’ll be doing real work on live campaigns, not making tea.
• Mentorship & Training: One-on-one guidance from seasoned copywriters and marketing pros. They’ll coach you, give feedback on your work, and help you sharpen your writing and creative thinking skills.
• Portfolio Development: A chance to build a portfolio of published work – from social posts and articles to web content – that you can proudly show future employers. Nothing beats saying “I wrote this” about content actually out in the world.
• Industry Exposure: Experience the ins and outs of modern B2B marketing. You’ll gain insight into multi-channel campaigns, learn about agency life, and even work on campaigns for well-known global tech brands, giving you a broad perspective on the industry.
• Career Opportunities: By the end of your 6–12 months with us, you won’t be a beginner anymore. High-performing interns may transition into full-time roles with MOI Global – we view our internship as a pipeline for future talent. (In fact, many of our past interns are now permanent team members!)
• Team Culture & Networks: Immerse yourself in an energetic, creative team that values ideas and initiative. You’ll make professional connections (and great friends) and experience an agency culture that’s collaborative, inclusive, and fun.
Who We’re Looking For

We welcome current students as well as recent graduates who are excited to dive into copywriting and marketing. The ideal candidate will tick many of these boxes:
• Education: You are currently pursuing or have recently completed a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing, Communications, Journalism, English, or a related field.
• Writing Prowess: You have a strong command of the English language (British English fluency is a plus) with excellent grammar, and you love writing. Whether it’s a snappy tagline or a long-form article, you take pride in crafting clear, creative content.
• Creative Mindset: Imaginative and forward-thinking, you’re brimming with fresh ideas. You aren’t afraid to think outside the box and experiment with new angles or storytelling techniques in your copy.
• Keen to Learn: A quick learner who’s eager to absorb everything about marketing and brand storytelling. You ask questions, seek feedback, and continuously refine your skills.
• Digital Savvy: Familiar with digital marketing channels and content formats – including social media platforms, email marketing, blogs/SEO, and maybe even a bit of video or multimedia content. (You know how different channels require different tones and approaches.)
• Research & Adaptability: Excellent research skills with the ability to gather information on unfamiliar topics quickly. You can adapt your writing style to suit different audiences and industries, from tech-savvy decision makers to general readers.
• Organised & Reliable: Able to juggle multiple projects and meet deadlines in a fast-paced environment. You stay organised, pay attention to detail (your spelling and punctuation are always on point), and can handle feedback and revisions with a positive attitude.
• Team Player: Great communication skills and a collaborative spirit. You can work well with designers, marketers, and other writers, and you’re happy to share ideas and also take direction when needed.
• Passion for Marketing: You’re genuinely interested in the world of marketing and advertising, especially B2B marketing. You’re the type of person who wants to know what makes audiences tick and how great campaigns are put together.
• Bonus Points: If you have knowledge of analytics or content performance tools (e.g. Google Analytics, social media insights) – that’s a plus. It shows you’re interested in how creative content performs and how to make it even better.

SEN Teacher. County Education & Training,REESON Education,"Durham, United Kingdom","Position: SEN Teacher. Job in County Education & Training Jobs

Overview

SEN Teacher
• Good School with Outstanding Features
• Key Stage 4 Complex Needs Class
• SEN Teacher Role
• 8 Pupils and 2 full time TAs
• Ealing LA
• Excellent Public Transport Links
• 2-3 term Maternity Cover

A vacancy has arisen for an SEN Teacher to join a high achieving, friendly and successful SEN school in Ealing. This SEN teacher role has come up as a member of staff will be going off on maternity from the October half term. The Headteacher wants to ensure there is a comprehensive handover and would like to appoint from September, most likely through to the end of the academic year.

As a result the school are seeking an SEN teacher to take on one of their KS4 complex needs classes.

This excellent Ealing SEN school is for students with a wide range of complex needs. It is co-educational and caters for up to 95 children and young adults aged from 7 - 19. The building comprises of ten classrooms, a therapy room, Food Technology, Art Room, a kitchen and a hall which doubles as a gym. The school has 2 minibuses which are used regularly for educational visits and school journeys.

There was a new wing opened in 2008 which houses the Sixth Form and an additional kitchen. A brand new state of the art sensory room opened in September and has already proved highly successful.

The Headteacher is a fantastically inclusive and realistic leader who understands the demands placed on his teachers and works to ensure that the resources, training, support and infrastructure are all in place so that his staff and ultimately the pupils are set up to succeed. The school has a burgeoning reputation and there is significant interest from the LA and parents outside of the borough for school expansion, talks are ongoing surrounding additional capacity for September.

For this reason there is a great chance that a permanent position in school would be available in September subject to the usual processes in line with equal opportunities legislation.

The class consists of 8 pupils with a range of needs including down syndrome, global developmental delay, one child with a complex medical condition and one pupils with severe arthritis and learning difficulties. The pupils attainment levels are between P6 and P8 so experience working in either complex needs or in EYFS would be advantageous. Behaviour in class and across the school in general is good and the two full time TAs will be a fantastic help getting you attuned to the needs and routines of the class.

All the pupils in class are verbal but some Makaton and PECs usage will occur in class to support learning.

The ideal teacher will be able to plan, deliver and assess lessons that focus on a sensory curriculum, have good behaviour and classroom management skills, have a proven track record as a ""good"" teacher and bring passion and commitment to their job.

This is a wonderful opportunity to join a forward thinking, supportive and successful school. Applications from overseas trained teachers with relevant experience are welcomed. Likewise applications from good or outstanding mainstream teachers are encouraged

• A natural eye for detail, from the shine on a glass to the tone of a welcome
• A flexible, can-do attitude and the ability to remain calm and elegant under pressure

Why Connaught?

Because here, mealtimes are more than menus—they’re moments. Our bistros and bars aren’t afterthoughts—they’re the heart of our homes. As Hospitality Manager, you’ll play a central role in making our residents (and their loved ones) feel not just cared for, but cherished.

You’ll work in a stunning environment, with autonomy, trust, and the chance to lead something special—bringing energy, empathy and five-star finesse to every shift. And of course, you’ll be part of a culture that helps you Live a Life More Extraordinary too.

If you believe hospitality should be heartfelt, that great service is never just about the service, and you love bringing joy to the everyday—we’d love to hear from you.

• Own casework end-to-end, ensuring timely resolution, clear communication, and consistent follow-through.

Cross-Functional Collaboration & Feedback Loop
• Collaborate with product, engineering, and operations teams to document and relay customer insights that eliminate defects in the customer experience.
• Partner with cross-functional specialists to identify opportunities for customers to unlock additional Coinbase features, services, and products.

What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):
• Exceptional communication and executive presence; able to engage high-net-worth clients with empathy, professionalism, and clarity.
• Strong investigative and analytical skills with the ability to identify patterns, assess risk, and recommend solutions.
• Proven track record of handling complex issues end-to-end, balancing urgency with thoughtful problem-solving.
• Comfort with ambiguity and change; able to thrive in a fast-paced environment where new challenges emerge daily.
• A bias for action and ownership; you see problems through to resolution and proactively raise opportunities to add value.
• Deep interest in crypto, financial markets, and emerging technology; eager to continuously learn and apply that knowledge in customer interactions.
• Minimum of 1 year of relevant experience in a customer service or support role in a fast paced environment including working with high value customers.
• Willingness to work nights and weekends to support the 24/7 nature of cryptocurrency markets.

Nice to haves:

Of course, you’ll tailor your approach to the guest’s needs by listening, anticipating, and offering tips to create that WOW experience.

If a guest unexpectedly has a complaint? No problem, you resolve it, possibly together with a colleague or supervisor.

Your flexibility allows you to work this shift in the evening or at night as well.

Corendon has entered into a partnership with the global hotel chain Marriott.

This means that while we maintain our unique Corendon identity, we are now part of the Marriott portfolio.

When you join us, you will receive full training according to Marriott standards. This also includes getting familiar with the Opera system.

We would be happy to tell you more about our current developments and exciting journey during a potential interview.
